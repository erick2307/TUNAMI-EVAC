# TUNAMI-EVAC (v2.0)

In this repository you will find an [Agent-Based Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model) developed for [Tsunami Evacuation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-015-1105-y) Analysis.  
The model was developed using [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) v.5.0.1 back in 2012.  
The details of the development and applications are described in my [PhD Thesis](/resources/PhD_Thesis_ErickMas.pdf) at [Tohoku University](http://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/).  

The model has not been updated since 2014 (published on April 2022 in Github, I know...why so late? no idea!).  
My latest trial of the model worked in Version 6.2.2 of NetLogo. (2022.04.20)

The case test in this repo takes about 15 min to run a simulation of a 70 min evacuation.
